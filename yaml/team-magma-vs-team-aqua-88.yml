name: Double Rainbow Energy
supertype: Energy
subtypes:
- Special
rules:
- Double Rainbow Energy can be attached only to an Evolved Pokémon (excluding Pokémon-ex).
  While in play, Double Rainbow Energy provides every type of Energy but provides
  2 Energy at a time. (Doesn't count as a basic Energy when not in play and has no
  effect other than providing Energy.) Damage done to your opponent's Pokémon by the
  Pokémon Double Rainbow Energy is attached to is reduced by 10 (after applying Weakness
  and Resistance). When the Pokémon Double Rainbow Energy is attached to is no longer
  an Evolved Pokémon, discard Double Rainbow Energy.
